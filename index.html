        <h2>Project Outline</h2>
        <p>The primary objective of this project is to showcase the depth of my skills and knowledge in Computer Science and Android Studio Development by enhancing the Zoo Monitoring System artifact across three critical areas: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. This artifact, initially created as a terminal-based application, will be progressively improved to meet industry standards and demonstrate mastery of key course outcomes. The enhancements will transform the original program into a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly Android application, fully integrating modern software engineering practices.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Categories:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Software Engineering and Design</li>
            <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
            <li>Databases</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Course Outcomes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.</li>
            <li>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.</li>
            <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</li>
            <li>Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="artifact-introduction">
        <h2>Artifact Introduction</h2>
        <p>The artifact selected for this project is the **Zoo Monitoring System**, a command-line Java program I developed in my IT145 course. This application functions as a tool for monitoring and managing information related to animals and habitats within a zoo environment. Users can select specific animal and habitat types to view detailed information and receive alert notifications when necessary.</p> 
        <p>This artifact was chosen because it effectively showcases my growth in software development and serves as an ideal foundation for demonstrating my skills in Android development. The original design features a robust navigation structure for data viewing and alerting, reflecting my abilities in UI and interaction event design. The artifact, by the end of this project, has been significantly enhanced by migrating its features to the Android mobile platform, thereby improving the overall user experience and modernizing its functionality.</p>
